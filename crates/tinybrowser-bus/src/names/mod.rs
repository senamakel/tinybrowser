//! The bus identity of the tinybrowser module: interface name, object path, and
//! one constant per member.
//!
//! Nothing here is a string literal at a call site. A host names a member
//! through [`methods`] and the object through [`OBJECT_PATH`], so a rename is a
//! compile error in every consumer rather than a runtime "unknown method".
//!
//! [`METHODS`] is kept in the same order as the interface's dispatch table in
//! `crates/tinybrowser/src/tinybus_module`, and that crate asserts the two
//! agree, so a member added to one and forgotten in the other fails the build.
